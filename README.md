# Time rewinding of fluid dynamics with PINN
- This repo shows a simple demonstration of time rewinding of fluid dynamics with PINN.
- Although the time-reversed simulation has been an ill-posed problem, PINN can provide a rough estimation of the past from the noisy observation.

# Note
- This is a proof-of-concept work, and there still are issues of convergence and seed-dependency.
